# pdata_notebooks

A collection of Jupyter notebooks showcasing various aspects of data science tasks and how they are tacked with the tools in the Python ecosystem in general and the `pdata` library in particular. 

You can install `pdata` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install pdata
```

Alternatively, it can be [cloned from Github](https://github.com/semeniuta/pdata) and put in a directory, whose path is stored in `CODEROOT` environment variable. In this case, the `initdirs.py` script is used before importing the library.
